# Hello, Rust

Let us begin with the classic Hello, World!

```
fn main() {
    println!("नमस्कार, विश्व!");
}
```

The above code prints "Hello, World!" in Sanskrit. 

If you already know programming lanagues such as C, you can already relate an equivalent code. ```fn main()``` servers as the main entry point of the program. ```println``` is system function that prints text on to the console.
