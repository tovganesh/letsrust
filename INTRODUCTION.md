# Introduction 
Rust, being a systems programming language, offers distinct advantages over traditional languages such as C and C++. While C and C++ have long been recognized and extensively utilized for systems programming, they suffer from limitations in memory management or the absence thereof.

Rust originated from a personal undertaking initiated by Graydon Hoare, an employee at Mozilla Research, in 2006. Subsequently, Mozilla started supporting the project in 2009, leading to its expansion into a broader community comprising developers and users of the language.
