# Introduction 
Rust, being a systems programming language, offers distinct advantages over traditional languages such as C and C++. While C and C++ have long been recognized and extensively utilized for systems programming, they suffer from limitations in memory management or the absence thereof.

Rust grew out of a personal project by Mozilla Research employee, Graydon Hoare in 2006. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 and since has grown into a wider community of developers and users of the language.
